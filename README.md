# Project Name - Tourism and Travel management system (Travely)

*Original one is integrated in SLIIT organization's private repository

Travely Live Website - https://travelylk.netlify.app/

(Frontend hosted using Netlify and Heroku used for backend)

We have successfully completed our Second-year, Second-semester ITP project using the MERN stack. Travely is a comprehensive Travel and Tourism website that offers convenient features such as Vehicle Reservations, Hotel Reservations(Not Included in the live website), Tour Packages, Restaurants, Train Bookings, and Event Bookings, all consolidated in one platform. To style our website, we employed Tailwind CSS. We diligently adhered to the Agile methodology throughout the project, ensuring efficient development. Furthermore, we leveraged GitHub for seamless system integration."
